## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Vehicle Length and Ground Clearence provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values. 
The formula for multiple linear regressions for mgp, results in a non-zero slope. 
The linear model predicts mpg of a MechaCar prototype effictively and we know this based on the R-squared value which is 0.7149, which indicates that there is a high liklihood that future data points will fit the linear model.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
The population mean is 1500 while the sample mean is 1498.78. The mean by manufacturing lots is very similar to that of the population and sample mean. 
Considering that the max variance from 100 PSI is 62 PSI, Lot 3 does not fall within the allowed range.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
The manufacturing lots, in total, are not statistically significant from the normal distribution. The mean falls within the 95% Confidence interval.

Manufacturing Lots 1 & 2 are not statistically significant from the normal distribution and normality can be assumed.

However, Lot 3 is statistically significant from the normal distribution and normality should not be assumed.
